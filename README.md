## Context

This repo is a basic layout of everything you would typically need on a webpage. These include:

- Responsive Navigation bar
  (HTML 17 - 30)(CSS 27 - 67, 156 - 170 (Hamburger menu icon 69 - 87, 174 - 210))
- Hero Section
  (HTML 40 - 45)(CSS 9 - 24)
- Night-mode/Light-mode
  (HTML 32 - 35)(CSS 1 - 5)(JS 1 -28)
- Footer
  (HTML 47 - 49)(CSS 134 -152)

All the pages include descriptive comments as to why I used certain properties.
